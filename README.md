# Integrate Accessibility in Your CI/CD Pipeline with sa11y

We are really excited to be presenting at #Dreamforce this year! In our #Dreamforce2023 session, Integrate Accessibility in Your CI/CD Pipeline with sa11y, we share our experience with accessibility testing, and how including sa11y in our PR validations helped us improve quality while delivering features faster. The session will take place at the Redwood Theater (Moscone West, Trailblazer Forest) on 9/12/2023 at 2:30 PM Pacific Time.
